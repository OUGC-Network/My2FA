## Alpha Release

Not suggested for production use. In the meantime feedback and suggestions are welcome. Lazy to-do list:

```
- backup codes
- email method (send otp via email)

- security mail notifications on disable of a method + use of a backup code
- postgresql tables
- templates caching
- hooks
```
