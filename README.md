# My2FA

A MyBB two-factor authentication for added account security.

## Alpha Release

Not suggested for production use. In the meantime feedback and suggestions are welcome. Lazy to-do list:

```
- recovery codes
- 2FA email method (send otp via email)

- security warning notifications (disable 2FA method and use of a recovery code)
- postgresql tables
- templates caching
- consider maybe rebuild option for boolean has_my2fa based on usable methods to use until acp management will be available (if will be)
- method id numeric???
- hooks
```
